# Understanding the Synchorization Properties of Two Coupled Izhikevich Neurons (USRA - 2024)

Similar to Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron, the Izhikevich neuron has a resetting condition, but, this model have a current variable u that modulates the faster voltage variable v. The current variable allow the Izhikevich neuron to show behaviours of subthreshold oscillation as observed biological neuron.
