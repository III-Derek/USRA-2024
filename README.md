# Understanding the Synchorization Properties of Two Coupled Izhikevich Neurons (USRA - 2024)

Similar to Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron, the Izhikevich neuron has a resetting condition, but, this model have a current variable u that modulates the faster voltage variable v. The current variable allow the Izhikevich neuron to show behaviours of subthreshold oscillation as observed biological neuron. As the popularity of artifical neural network grows, computational neuroscientists are becoming more interested in spiking neural network model where the weights in artifical neural networks are replaced by mathematical neuron models. The simplest such model is the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model, but it cannot exhibit complex behaviours as seen in Izhikevich neurons. In this project, we investigate the condition for synchronization of two coupled Izhikevich neurons via the interaction function developed for continuous dynamical systems. With an addition to the boundary value conditionn[1], we are able to produce the interaction function for Izhikevich neuron.
